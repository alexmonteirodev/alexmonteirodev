Hi there!

I'm Alex, a frontend developer with 1 year of freelance experience and currently residing in Spain.

I developed skills in | UI&UX | HTML5 | CSS3 | JavScript | React |

I study every day to get an opportunity in the area, collaborate with the team and, along the way, meet new people and expand my knowledge_ 

Outside of work, I'm interested in technology, investing, film, personal growth, and sports.

1% better every day! - "skills speak louder than words"
